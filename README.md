This project parses a folder full of CSV files to demonstrate the ability to use Python's os module to extract relevant data for this Client Project.

It builds on the previous work of deliverable-3 and ensures a seamless experience across all devices. 

**Accessibility** and **Compatibility** for mobile devices were the key considerations when building this deliverable.
  
More details about this deliverable are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f_0ehrJpbj2Ii1mK8pQ5dSy5eRq4sK0f_6HWJeLCrMY/edit?usp=sharing).
