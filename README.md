This project parses a folder full of CSV files to demonstrate the ability to use Python's os module to extract relevant data for our Client Project.

It builds on the previous work of deliverable-2 and styles the webpage using CSS/JavaScript. 

**Accessibility** and **Compatibility** for mobile devices were the key considerations when building this deliverable.
  
The results are displayed on HTML templates and act as a foundation for futher deliverables. More details about this deliverable are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9S06dYWMqytT44sLFH89e6mjbOBqwD5yeTDOgRdZAE/edit?usp=sharing). 

All code that was **NOT** covered in class is referenced at the end of the report.
